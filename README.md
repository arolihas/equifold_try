Implementing [Equifold](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.07.511322v1) which relies on [Equiformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11990v1)

* [ ] Equivariant Graph Attention module (`e3nn` as cited)

* [ ] Equiformer architecture

* [ ] Coarse grained representation

* [ ] Geometric tensor and embedding

* [ ] Iterative refinement for structure prediction

* [ ] Adapted EGA block

* [ ] Loss functions (FAPE, structure violation)

* [ ] Training with hyperparameters
