Implementing [Equifold](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.07.511322v1) which relies on [Equiformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11990v1)

Using `e3nn` for Equivariant Graph Attention module, as cited in Equiformer

[] Equivariant Graph Attention module
[] Equiformer architecture
[] Coarse grained representation
[] Geometric tensor and embedding
[] Adapted EGA module
[] Loss functions
[] Training with hyperparameters
